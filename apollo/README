apollo_exporter.pl exports from the XML based Apollo LDF format to postgres staging stages.  

To Do:

authorities
holidays (we usually se those manually)
locations (we've only had single locations to test with so far)
patron attributes not seen in export and not supported here - vacations, wish list, photos, phone carriers
seen in extract and not migrated Purchase Request, Passwords (bcrypted and salted), Call Range, inventoryHolding, problems (notes/Holding), booklists
user defined values are set manually here and should be done programatically so they don't have to be set manually each time probably to a distinct
table rather than in patrons
