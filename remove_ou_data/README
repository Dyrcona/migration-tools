This is a set of SQL scripts to be run, in order, to completely
remove data belonging to an OU and its descendants in an Evergreen
database.  Each script uses a variable called ou_to_del that should
be set to the shortname of the OU to remove.

After running through the scripts, it should be possible to
remove the actor.org_unit entries themselves.

TODO:

-- remove some reporter folders/reports/schedules
-- remove event output that is no longer associated with any events
