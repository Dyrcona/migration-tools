This is a set of SQL scripts to be run, in order, to completely
remove data belonging to an OU and its descendants in an Evergreen
database.  Each script uses a variable called ou_to_del that should
be set to the shortname of the OU to remove.

Generate script to delete users:

SELECT 'DELETE FROM actor.usr WHERE id = ' || id || ';'
FROM actor.usr WHERE home_ou IN (
    SELECT (actor.org_unit_descendants(id)).id FROM actor.org_unit
    WHERE shortname = 'EXAMPLE'
);

After running through the scripts, it should be possible to
remove the actor.org_unit entries themselves.

TODO:

-- remove event output that is no longer associated with any events
-- remvoe user address auditor entries
