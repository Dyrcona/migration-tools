The dedupe can be used for an inclusive (whole contents of biblio.record_entry) dedupe 
or a uni-directional dedupe where the contents of m_biblio_record_entry / _legacy 
are considered incoming records and then deduped against the contents of biblio.record_entry.

In a migration dedupe scenario only incumbent (biblio.record_entry) records can be lead 
records in match groups.

Because this is heavily used for migration dedupes with the mig toolset the script will look 
for an m_biblio_record_entry table in the path.  If it finds this it will assume this is a 
migration dedupe and set a dedupe_features flag appropriately which the remainder of the scripts will use.

There is a third dedupe type - 'subset' for this the type will have to be set manually and is largely untested.
